### üìå Supplier & Client Vetting Automation  
A highly detailed, multi-platform supplier and client vetting automation developed for the Master Data team to manage regulatory compliance and risk screening. The solution automated the collection of supplier information, reputation checks, financial stability validations, and sanction screening, integrating various government, financial, and legal data sources. The entire process was multilingual and region-specific, providing tailored results for markets in Germany, the UK, and The Netherlands.

**Tools:**  
- **UiPath:** The primary automation tool responsible for executing all vetting workflows, handling browser-based data extraction and interactions with secured portals.  
- **Power Apps:** Provided an input form for master data users to submit supplier details, with built-in field validation, mandatory field checks, and dynamic dropdown menus for countries and search types.  
- **Power Automate:** Received form submissions, formatted details for regex-friendly processing, and dispatched them via email to trigger UiPath bot execution.  
- **Azure SQL Database:** Logged process steps, errors, market origins, and audit records for SLA tracking and operational insights.  
- **Power BI:** Consolidated performance metrics and exceptions into actionable dashboards for continuous process improvement.

**System Integrations:**  
- **Nexis Diligence+ via OKTA Auth:** Conducted sanctions and negative press checks for companies or individuals.  
- **Dun & Bradstreet:** Pulled company financial reports and risk profiles.  
- **SurveyMonkey API:** Sent supplier feedback surveys post-vetting.  
- **ServiceNow API:** Logged exceptions, retries, and error notifications as tickets for IT support follow-ups.  
- **Google Search (multi-language):** Performed reputational checks in English, Dutch, and German markets.  
- **VAT & Company Registries:** Validated supplier tax and registration numbers through multiple European platforms.  
- **Azure Blob Storage:** Archived final vetting reports, screenshots, and financial documents for compliance audits.  
- **Outlook / SharePoint:** Shared final reports and audit documents with business users via secure, time-limited SharePoint folders.

<h3>üé• RPA Challenge: Solving the Dynamic Form Data Entry</h3>
<p>I recently participated in an exciting <strong>RPA Challenge</strong> from <a href="https://rpachallenge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rpachallenge.com</a>, where the goal was to create an automated workflow capable of inputting data from a spreadsheet into dynamic form fields that change position after every submission. The challenge had the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Input Automation:</strong> The workflow needed to automatically input data into form fields that change positions after each submission, for a total of <strong>10 rounds</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Field Recognition:</strong> Since the positions of the fields shift after every submission, the workflow had to <strong>dynamically identify</strong> where each piece of data from the spreadsheet should go, ensuring accuracy on every round.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing Constraints:</strong> The challenge also had a <strong>countdown timer</strong> that started once the "Start" button was clicked, adding pressure to complete the task efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch my full solution in action in this YouTube video, where I walk through the <strong>workflow design</strong> and explain the approach I used to ensure <strong>accuracy, speed, and scalability</strong> across the 10 rounds of changing fields. This showcases my skills in <strong>workflow design, dynamic field handling, problem-solving, and efficient automation development</strong>.</p>
